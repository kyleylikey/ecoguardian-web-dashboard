# API Base URL Configuration
# Choose one of the following based on your use case:

# Option 1: Local development only (default)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Option 2: Network access (other devices on same network)
# Replace 192.168.1.100 with your actual network IP address
# To find your IP: run the server and it will display your network IP
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000

# Option 3: Production deployment
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-deployed-backend-url.com

# Note: WebSocket URL is automatically derived from VITE_API_BASE_URL
# Example: http://192.168.1.100:3000 becomes ws://192.168.1.100:3000
